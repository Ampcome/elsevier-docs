# Introduction

## What is Publishing Services Permissions Seeking?

Publishing Services Permissions Seeking is a critical business function within Elsevier's Health Content Management (HCM) division. It manages the complex process of obtaining rights to reuse third-party content in Elsevier publications.

## Purpose

When Elsevier wants to include content from external sources—such as figures, tables, images, or text excerpts—in its books, journals, or educational materials, the Permissions Seeking team:

1. **Identifies** the rights holder for each piece of content
2. **Contacts** them through appropriate channels
3. **Negotiates** usage terms and licensing fees
4. **Documents** all permissions in the Rights & Permissions Collector (RPC)
5. **Tracks** the status of each request through completion
