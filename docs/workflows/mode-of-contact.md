![Rightsholder Identification & Verification](/diagrams/07_Rightsholder_Identification_Verification.svg)

### Verification Steps

1. **Check Copyright Notice** - Who is listed?
2. **Review Author Agreement** - If accessible
3. **Check Transfer Records** - Publisher databases
4. **Verify Current Status** - Has ownership changed?
5. **Confirm Contact Authority** - Can they grant permission?

## Multi-Channel Strategy

When initial contact fails:

```
Day 0: Primary channel (author email or portal)
       ↓ No response
Day 7: Secondary channel (alternative email)
       ↓ No response
Day 14: Tertiary channel (institution/publisher)
       ↓ No response
Day 21: Escalation channel (manager contact)
       ↓ No response
Day 28: Decision point (close/alternative)
```

## Documentation Requirements

For each contact attempt, record:

- **Date/Time** of contact
- **Channel** used
- **Contact Person** name and email
- **Content** of request (template reference)
- **Response** received (if any)
- **Next Steps** planned
