# Science & Technology (S&T) Workflows

## Overview

Science & Technology (S&T) permissions handle scientific journals, technical publications, and research materials. S&T uses Tiers 1-3 for RREF, Hot Topics, and MRW divisions.

### Volume

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **S&T Projects/Year** | 1,480 |

## S&T-Specific Characteristics

| Aspect | S&T Characteristics |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Content Types** | Research figures, data visualizations, technical diagrams |
| **Rights Holders** | Scientific publishers, research institutions, societies |
| **Divisions** | RREF, Hot Topics, MRW (Major Reference Works) |

## S&T Tier Definitions

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Tier 1** | Author obtains all permissions and provides log. CS validates and uploads logs/files to RPC |
| **Tier 2** | Author provides permission log. CS obtains permissions. CS uploads logs/files to RPC |
| **Tier 3** | Author submits manuscript. CS creates log and obtains permissions. CS uploads logs/files to RPC |

### Role Key
- **CS** = Copyrights Specialist

## Tier 1 - S&T Workflow

### Chapter Tracker Integration

S&T uses a Chapter Tracker system for workflow management:

### Tier 1 Process

1. Author obtains all permissions
2. Author provides completed permission log
3. CS validates log completeness and accuracy
4. CS uploads logs and files to RPC

---

## Tier 2 - S&T Workflow

### Tier 2 Process

1. Author provides permission log identifying items needing permission
2. CS reviews and validates the log
3. CS contacts rightsholders to obtain permissions
4. CS tracks responses and sends follow-up chasers
5. CS uploads completed logs and files to RPC

---

## Tier 3 - S&T Workflow (Full Service)

### Tier 3 Process

1. Author submits manuscript only
2. CS reviews manuscript for third-party content
3. CS creates permission log from scratch
4. CS identifies all items requiring permissions
5. CS contacts all rightsholders
6. CS tracks all responses
7. CS uploads completed logs and files to RPC

## S&T-Specific Considerations

### Research Data Permissions

- **Data Visualization** - May need separate permission from data
- **Supplementary Materials** - Often different license than article
- **Datasets** - May have separate DOI and terms
- **Code/Software** - Check software license compatibility

### Conference Proceedings

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **IEEE Conference** | Through IEEE rights portal |
| **ACM Conference** | ACM Digital Library permissions |
| **Society Conference** | Contact society directly |
| **Independent Conference** | May revert to authors |

### Preprint Considerations

- **arXiv** - Usually author retains rights
- **bioRxiv** - CC-BY common, verify version
- **SSRN** - Author agreement varies
- **Version Matching** - Ensure figures match published version

### S&T Quality Checkpoints

1. **DOI Verification** - Correct article identified?
2. **Figure Numbering** - Right figure from right paper?
3. **Version Control** - Preprint vs. published version?
4. **Rights Transfer** - Did author sign over rights?
5. **Supplementary Check** - Is content from supplement?
