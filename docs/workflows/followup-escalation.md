# Follow-up & Escalation

## Overview

Systematic follow-up is critical to permission success. This guide covers timing, methods, and escalation procedures.

## Standard Follow-up Cadence

The permission workflow uses a structured reminder schedule tracked in RPC:

### Reminder Schedule (from RPC Chapter Tracker)

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Intro Email** | Initial outreach to author/rightsholder |
| **First Reminder** | First follow-up if no response |
| **Second Reminder** | Second follow-up |
| **First Chaser** | More urgent follow-up |
| **Second Chaser** | Final follow-up |
| **Third Chaser** | Last attempt before decision |

### RPC Tracking Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Intro Email Due Date | Scheduled initial outreach |
| Intro Email Sent Date | Confirmation of send |
| MS Due Date | Manuscript deadline |
| First Reminder Due/Sent Date | First follow-up tracking |
| Second Reminder Due/Sent Date | Second follow-up tracking |
| First Chaser Due/Sent Date | First chaser tracking |
| Second Chaser Due/Sent Date | Second chaser tracking |

## Follow-up Email Guidelines

### First Reminder

**Tone**: Friendly reminder
**Content**:
- Reference original request date
- Restate the specific content needed
- Offer to clarify any questions
- Provide deadline if applicable

### Second Reminder

**Tone**: More direct
**Content**:
- Acknowledge their busy schedule
- Emphasize importance/timeline
- Offer alternative contact methods
- Suggest simple response options

### Chaser Emails

**Tone**: Urgent but professional
**Content**:
- Clear deadline statement
- Consequences of non-response
- Final opportunity to respond
- Alternative options if no response

## Escalation Procedures

### When to Escalate

| Trigger | Escalation Path |
|---------|-----------------|
| No response after full cadence | Team Lead review |
| Unreasonable fee quoted | Manager approval |
| Legal/terms concerns | Legal department |
| High-value content needed | Manager decision |
| Author dispute | Senior specialist |
| Timeline at risk | Editorial + Manager |

### Escalation Levels

```
Level 1: Self-Resolution
├── Follow standard cadence
├── Try alternative contacts
└── Document all attempts

Level 2: Team Lead
├── Review case history
├── Suggest alternative approaches
└── May contact rights holder directly

Level 3: Manager
├── Fee approval authority
├── Publisher relationship leverage
└── Editorial timeline negotiations

Level 4: Legal/Executive
├── Complex rights disputes
├── Litigation risk
└── Policy decisions
```

## Alternative Contact Strategies

### When Primary Contact Fails

1. **Co-Authors** - Contact other listed authors
2. **Institution** - Try departmental/university contact
3. **Publisher** - Even for author-owned content
4. **Professional Networks** - LinkedIn, ResearchGate
5. **Phone** - If available (use sparingly)

### Research Strategies

| Source | How to Use |
|--------|-----------|
| **Google Search** | "[Author name] + contact email" |
| **Institution Site** | Faculty directory |
| **Recent Papers** | May have updated contact |
| **ORCID** | Often maintained |
| **Conference Sites** | Speaker contact info |

## Handling Non-Response

### After Full Cadence - Decision Matrix

| Situation | Recommended Action |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Content essential, no alternatives | Escalate to Manager |
| Alternative available | Document, use alternative |
| Low priority item | Close as unresponsive |
| Publisher may own rights | Contact publisher |
| Legal risk if used | Do not use, document |

### Documentation for Non-Response

Record in RPC:
- All contact attempts with dates
- Channels used
- Contact information tried
- Final decision and rationale
- Alternative action taken

## Response Handling

### Permission Granted

1. Confirm terms match request
2. Document any conditions
3. Process any fees
4. Update RPC status
5. Provide credit line to editorial
6. Archive correspondence

### Permission Denied

1. Document reason for denial
2. Assess if negotiation possible
3. Notify editorial immediately
4. Research alternatives
5. Update RPC with outcome

### Conditional Permission

1. Review conditions carefully
2. Assess if acceptable
3. Escalate unusual conditions
4. Get editorial approval if needed
5. Document exact terms
6. Track any follow-up requirements

## Timeline Management

### Proactive Communication

| Milestone | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Project Start | Assess permission volume |
| 50% Complete | Review at-risk items |
| 75% Complete | Escalate blockers |
| Final Deadline - 2 weeks | Status report to editorial |
| Final Deadline - 1 week | Emergency escalation |

### At-Risk Indicators

- Multiple items unresponsive from same source
- High-fee items awaiting approval
- Complex negotiations ongoing
- Legal review pending
- Editorial changes affecting scope

## Key Timeliness Target

The primary KPI for permissions workflow is **completion 30 days prior to Files To Printer (FTP) date**.
