![HS vs S&T Comparison](/diagrams/19_HS_vs_ST_Comparison.svg)

## Overview

Health Sciences (HS) permissions handle medical textbooks, clinical references, and healthcare education materials. The HS division uses a specific tier structure tailored to health content workflows.

### Volume

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **HS Projects/Year** | 770 |

## HS-Specific Characteristics

| Aspect | HS Characteristics |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Content Types** | Medical images, clinical photos, anatomical diagrams |
| **Rights Holders** | Medical journals, healthcare publishers, institutions |
| **Sensitivity** | Patient privacy, clinical accuracy critical |

## HS Tier Definitions

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Tier 0** | CDS/Author obtains all permissions. CS validates and uploads logs/files to RPC |
| **Tier 4** | CDS provides permission log. CS obtains permissions. CS uploads logs/files to RPC |
| **Rule of 10** | No permission seeking - CS only does Rule of 10 assessment |

### Role Key
- **CDS** = Content Development Specialist
- **CS** = Copyrights Specialist

## Tier 0 - HS Workflow

### Eligibility Check

|-------|--------|
| **Copyright Status** | Verify public domain or CC license |

## Tier 4 - HS Workflow

### Initial Processing

1. **Item Receipt** - New item appears in RPC queue
2. **Source Review** - Examine original publication
3. **Author Identification** - Find corresponding/rights-holding author
4. **Contact Search** - Locate current email address

### Author Contact Strategies

| Source | Method |
|--------|--------|
| **Publication Contact Info** | Use email from paper |
| **Institutional Directory** | Search university/hospital sites |
| **ORCID/Google Scholar** | Academic profile lookup |
| **PubMed/CrossRef** | Citation database search |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional network (last resort) |

### Request Content

Standard Tier 4 request includes:

- Clear identification of content needed
- Specific usage description (book title, chapter, format)
- Rights scope (territory, duration, format)
- Credit line proposal
- Response deadline
- Contact information

### Follow-up Schedule

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Day 0 | Initial request sent |
| Day 7 | First follow-up if no response |
| Day 14 | Second follow-up |

## Rule of 10 - HS Workflow

### Trigger Identification

Rule of 10 applies when:
- 10+ items requested from same publication/publisher
- Publisher is known rights holder
- Bulk discount opportunity exists

### Publisher Contact Process

1. **Inventory** - Compile all items from source
2. **Publisher Research** - Identify rights/permissions contact
3. **Request Preparation** - Detailed list with specifications
4. **Submission** - Send via preferred channel (email/portal)
5. **Tracking** - Monitor in RPC as single grouped request

### Negotiation Points

| Factor | Negotiation Approach |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Fee Per Item** | Request bulk discount |
| **Usage Scope** | Clarify exact needs, avoid over-licensing |
| **Duration** | Match to publication lifecycle |
| **Format Rights** | Bundle print + electronic when possible |

## HS-Specific Considerations

### Medical Image Requirements

- **Patient Consent** - Verify consent for identifiable images
- **Model Releases** - Required for recognizable individuals
- **Clinical Accuracy** - Note any required updates/disclaimers
- **Institutional Approval** - Some hospitals require IRB sign-off

### Common HS Publishers

| Publisher | Contact Method | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Wolters Kluwer** | Online portal | Formal process |
| **Springer Nature** | RightsLink/Email | Generally responsive |
| **Wiley** | RightsLink | Standard fees |
| **BMJ** | Email | Academic pricing available |
| **NEJM** | Permissions email | Strict terms |

### HS Quality Checkpoints

1. **Source Accuracy** - Is citation correct?
2. **Rights Holder Verification** - Confirmed owner?
3. **Contact Information** - Current and valid?
4. **Usage Scope** - Matches editorial needs?
5. **Documentation** - Complete RPC record?
