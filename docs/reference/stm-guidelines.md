## Overview

The **STM (International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers) Permissions Guidelines** provide a framework for reasonable reuse of published content within the academic/scientific community.

## What are STM Guidelines?

The STM Guidelines establish best practices for:
- Granting permissions between STM publishers
- Defining reasonable use thresholds
- Standardizing terms and conditions
- Facilitating scholarly communication

## Key Principles

### Reciprocity

STM member publishers agree to:
- Grant permissions to each other's authors
- Use standardized terms
- Waive or minimize fees for qualifying uses
- Process requests promptly

### Reasonable Use

Defined thresholds for use without fee:
- Up to 3 figures/tables from a journal article
- Up to 3 figures/tables from a book chapter
- Text excerpts under defined word limits

## Qualifying Conditions

### For STM Guidelines to Apply

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Both parties STM members** | Check membership list |
| **Scholarly purpose** | Academic/educational use |
| **Proper attribution** | Full citation required |
| **Limited quantity** | Within thresholds |
| **Non-competing** | Not a competing product |

### Exclusions

STM Guidelines typically do NOT cover:
- Commercial products
- Marketing materials
- Complete articles
- Systematic reproduction
- Non-STM publishers

## Quantitative Thresholds

### Figures and Tables

| Source Type | Threshold |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Journal Article** | Up to 3 figures/tables |
| **Book Chapter** | Up to 3 figures/tables |
| **Entire Book** | Subject to publisher policy |

### Text Excerpts

| Source Type | Threshold |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Journal Article** | Up to 400 words single extract |
| **Journal Article** | Up to 800 words total |
| **Book** | Varies by publisher |

### Notes

- Thresholds are cumulative across requests
- Check if content was previously used
- Different publishers may have variations

## Applying STM Guidelines

### Step 1: Verify Eligibility

1. Is the source publisher an STM member?
2. Is Elsevier an STM member? (Yes)
3. Is the use scholarly/educational?
4. Is the quantity within thresholds?

### Step 2: Check Specific Terms

Even with STM, publishers may:
- Have specific requirements
- Require written confirmation
- Need credit line in specific format
- Have additional restrictions

### Step 3: Document Compliance

Record in RPC:
- STM Guidelines cited
- Threshold verification
- Any specific terms from publisher
- Credit line used

## STM Member Lookup

### How to Verify

1. Visit stm-assoc.org
2. Check member directory
3. Or search publisher permissions page

### Major STM Members

| Publisher | STM Member |
|-----------|------------|
| Springer Nature | Yes |
| Wiley | Yes |
| Elsevier | Yes |
| Taylor & Francis | Yes |
| SAGE | Yes |
| OUP | Yes |
| ACS | Yes |

*Always verify current status*

## Credit Line Requirements

### Standard Format

```
Reprinted from [Article Title], [Authors], [Journal],
Vol. [X], Issue [Y], Pages [Z], Copyright [Year],
with permission from [Publisher].
```

### Example

```
Reprinted from "Advances in Gene Therapy," Smith et al.,
Nature Medicine, Vol. 25, Issue 3, Pages 123-130,
Copyright 2024, with permission from Springer Nature.
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Within Thresholds

**Situation**: Using 2 figures from a Nature article

**Action**:
- Verify Springer Nature STM membership
- Confirm scholarly use
- Apply STM terms
- May not require formal request
- Document in RPC

### Scenario 2: Exceeds Thresholds

**Situation**: Need 5 figures from same article

**Action**:
- STM doesn't fully apply
- Contact publisher for permission
- May involve fee
- Document specific approval

### Scenario 3: Non-Member Publisher

**Situation**: Content from non-STM publisher

**Action**:
- STM Guidelines don't apply
- Standard permission request required
- Follow normal tier workflow

## Limitations and Cautions

### What STM Doesn't Cover

| Not Covered | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Complete works** | Beyond reasonable use |
| **Systematic copying** | Commercial concern |
| **Non-academic use** | Outside guidelines scope |
| **Original artwork** | Special considerations |
| **Patient photos** | Privacy concerns |

### When to Still Request

Even within thresholds, request permission when:
- Publisher requires written confirmation
- High-profile content
- Potential competing use
- Any uncertainty

## Best Practices

### Documentation

- Note STM applicability in RPC
- Record threshold calculations
- Save any publisher confirmations
- Document credit line used

### Quality Assurance

- Double-check member status
- Verify threshold calculations
- Confirm use is truly scholarly
- Review specific publisher requirements
