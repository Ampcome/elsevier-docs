### Permissions Update Email (to Authors)

**Subject**: < [Book Title] ; [ISBN] > : Permissions update
**From**: permissionshelpdesk@elsevier.com
**Attachments**: Sample permission log.xlsx, Permission log.xlsx, Permission Guidelines.docx

```
Dear Author,

I hope you are well. I am writing with regard to the permissions for
the book [Book Title].

As you are likely already aware, as the author you are responsible for
obtaining written permission to reuse any third-party images, figures,
tables and/or substantial text excerpts appearing in your [chapter/book]
and for providing copies of these permissions.

Kindly note that we cannot legally publish the book until we receive the
permission files for your chapter/book.

If you have accepted writing the book/chapters in EMSS platform, please
follow the below steps:

Step 1: Submit both the completed permission log and copies of all
permission licenses for any third-party images, figures, tables, boxes
used in your [chapter/book] to Permissions Helpdesk
(permissionshelpdesk@elsevier.com). Please ensure to update the yellow
highlighted columns in the permission log which are mandatory fields.

Step 2: Obtain any necessary permissions licenses or other approvals in
writing from the rightsholders of the materials – this is usually but not
always the publisher for any published works. Please also be aware that
some publishers may have a longer turnaround time and some permissions
may also be subject to fees.

Step 3: If your [chapter/book] exclusively contains only figures/tables
created by you or your co-author and therefore requires no permissions,
please confirm the same to Permissions Helpdesk.

Best regards,
Permissions Helpdesk Team
```
